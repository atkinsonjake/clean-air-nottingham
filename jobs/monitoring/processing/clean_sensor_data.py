    Filters rows in the DataFrame based on the absolute and percentage difference

    Args:
        dataframe (pd.DataFrame): A pandas DataFrame with air pollution data.
        channel_a (str): The name of the first channel (e.g., 'pm1.0_atm_a').
        channel_b (str): The name of the second channel (e.g., 'pm1.0_atm_b').
        max_diff (float, optional): The maximum acceptable absolute difference 
                                    in Î¼g between the two channels. Default is 5.
        max_pct_diff (float, optional): The maximum acceptable percentage difference 
                                        between the two channels, expressed as a fraction 
                                        (e.g., 0.61 for 61%). Default is 0.61.

    Convert a dictionary of sensor data into a pandas DataFrame.

    The input dictionary should have sensor IDs as keys and lists of measurement dictionaries as values.
